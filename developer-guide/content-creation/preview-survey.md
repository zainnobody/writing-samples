Previewing allows you to see how your survey will look in the app.

# Full-Stack Implementations

## API Endpoints

There are no API endpoints explicitly dedicated to previewing a survey. Rely on the previewing features of your development environment (for example, Visual Studio Code) if previewing in the portal doesn't meet your needs.

## Web Portal

We highly recommend you preview surveys through the Samsung Health Stack web portal. Preview is available at any point in the survey question creation process.

To preview a survey using the web portal:

1. Refer to [Previewing a Survey](../../portal-guide/content-creation/previewing-a-survey.md) in the web portal user guide.
