A survey is a sequence of questions that collect information from the participants in your study.

# Full-Stack Implementations

1. Refer to `POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks` in [Study API Endpoints](../../api-reference/study-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference.

To populate a survey using the API endpoints:

1. Refer to `PATCH /projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskid}` in [Study API Endpoints](../../api-reference/study-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference.
