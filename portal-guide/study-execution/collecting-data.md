Collecting data for the study is straightforward. The connected wearable device monitors and records a participant's health data. Surveys, scheduled at whatever frequency is appropriate, collect a participant's input.

Simply instruct each participant to:

- Wear the watch for the duration of the study.
- Open the app and complete the scheduled survey.
- Use the app to see visualizations of their data.
