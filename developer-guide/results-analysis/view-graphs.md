# Full-Stack Implementations

## API Endpoints

To create graphs and charts using the API endpoints:

1. Refer to `POST /projects/{projectId}/graphql` in [Study API Endpoints](../../api-reference/study-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference to fetch study data such as participant list, sensor data, task results.
2. Develop your own graphs and charts to display the information as needed for your use case.

## Web Portal

We highly recommend you use the Samsung Health Stack web portal to view graphs and charts representing the collected study data. The web portal provides line graphs and scatter plot charts for easy visualization of the data collected through your study. Each one provides views of the general trends and of datapoints filtered by demographic.

To view graphs and charts using the web portal:

1. Refer to [Viewing Graphs and Charts](../../portal-guide/results-analysis/viewing-graphs.md) in the web portal user guide.
