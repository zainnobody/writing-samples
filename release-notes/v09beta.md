# What's New

Samsung Health Stack version 0.9 (v0.9) beta is now available at [https://github.com/S-HealthStack](https://github.com/S-HealthStack){:target="_blank"}. The beta version contains many internal improvements and has gone through a rigorous verification process. The sections below describe what's new that is visible from the outside. 

## Documentation

The [s-healthstack.io](https://s-healthstack.io) documentation is now much more robust. It still primarily uses non-technical language, focused for non-developer researchers and describes in detail all features of the web portal.

The Developer Reference (found as the last category in the left navigation panel) now contains:

- The API Reference - improved with details for all account service, data query, and study API requests.
- The app SDK documentation - greatly improved and now publicly available.

## Health Connect

Samsung Health Stack has integrated the [Health Connect](https://developer.android.com/health-connect){:target="_blank"} API! In addition to our documentation, refer to the [Health Connect API developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect){:target="_blank"} for more information.

## Account Creation

Every member collaborating on a study needs a Samsung Health Stack account. In addition to the [command line account creation](../documentation/installation/install-backend.md#xv-create-initial-account) available in the alpha version, initial account creation is now available through an easy to use [web portal user interface](../documentation/installation/install-portal.md#iii-launch-web-portal-and-create-account).
