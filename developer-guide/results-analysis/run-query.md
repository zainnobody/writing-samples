# Full-Stack Implementations

## API Endpoints

To run a query using the API endpoints:

1. Refer to `POST /projects/{projectId}/graphql` in [Data Query Service API Endpoints](../../api-reference/data-query-service-api-endpoints.md).
2. Use your preferred method to view the resulting data.

## Web Portal

We highly recommend you use the Samsung Health Stack web portal to query your data. Querying within the web portal allows you to gain some simple insights into your data. You can run queries at any point in the study.
