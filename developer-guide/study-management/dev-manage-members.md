Members are the users who conduct the study and membership status is maintained at the study level

# Full-Stack Implementations

Samsung Health Stack puts no restrictions on the number of members under an organization, or the number of members working on a study.

## API Endpoints

To invite members and assign their role using the API endpoints:

1. Refer to `POST /account-service/invitations` in [Account Service API Endpoints](../../api-reference/account-service-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference.

To assign a role to an existing member using the API endpoints:

1. Refer to `PUT /account-service/user/roles` in [Account Service API Endpoints](../../api-reference/account-service-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference.


## Web Portal

We highly recommend you manage your team members through the Samsung Health Stack web portal.

To manage members using the web portal:

1. Refer to [Managing Members](../../portal-guide/study-management/portal-manage-members.md) in the web portal user guide.
