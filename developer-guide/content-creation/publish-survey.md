Once you've completed creating your survey questions, the next step is to schedule and publish the survey.

# Full-Stack Implementations

## API Endpoints

To schedule and publish a survey using the API endpoints:

1. Refer to `PATCH /projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}` in [Study API Endpoints](../../api-reference/study-api-endpoints.md) in the API reference.
